# Sudoku
Hi there! This code is built by me, Shannon, and Jessica, from my high school's Intro to Computer Program in Python class. This is a game we created called Sudoku, which is a very famous and popular game originated from Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician. All of the contents were self-coded, which had been run multiple times and finally turned into this finished game! In this game, you can choose level of difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard mode. Have fun!
